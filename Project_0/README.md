### Project description
game to guess a number given by computer using minimum amount of tries

[&#8593; go to outline](https://github.com/fermentedmilk1/sf_ds_python/blob/main/Project_0/README.md#outline)

### Objective
to make a game that would guess a number 

**Conditions**
- computer gives a random number from 1 to 100
- we have to write a programm that would guess it
- the algorithm should know if the guessed number is bigger or smaller

**Quality metrics**

Mean amount of tries for 1000 repeats

**What do we practice**
